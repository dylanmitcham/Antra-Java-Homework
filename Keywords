PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES
byte, short, int , long, float, double , char, boolean
A byte represents 8 bits
An int represents an integer value between -2^31 and 2^31-1
short is half the size of int but double the size of byte
long can represent a value between -2^63 and 2^63-1
float and double represent fractional numbers but double has a larger range and float must end with f i.e. float test = 3.1923f
boolean can be either true or false
a char is a 16 bit integer representing a unicode character

FLOW CONTROL
if , else, switch, case, default, for , do , while, break, continue, return
if (condition) {
   // execute code in block
} elseif (other condition) {
  // execute this instead
} else {
  // do this if the none of conditions were satisfied
}

while (condition) {
  // execute as long as the condition is true
}

do {
  // execute this while loop at least once even if it isn't true 
}

break will end the current loop while continue will only skip that round of the loop
return simply returns a value for a method

MODIFIERS
public, private, protected , static, final, abstract, synchronized, native, strictfp, transient, volatile
public access modifier means this class/method/attribute can be accessed by anyone
private limits access for methods and attributes to the class it was declared in
protected limits access for attributes and methods to the package and sub classes while default only allows for access from within the same package
final is a non access modifier that prevents a class from being inherited, and attributes/methods from being overwritten
an abstract method has no method body and must be filled out by the sub classes while an abstract class has abstract methods 
the static keyword means that attributes and methods belong to the class not the object
synchronized keyword means that only one thread can access the synchronized method/object at a time
volatile is used to add thread safety to attributes 
transient is used to prevent an object from serializable meaning it can be turned into a stream of bytes
native is used to indicate that method is implemented in native code using JNI
strictfp is used to ensure that operations with floats have the same result on every platform because the precision can vary across platforms 

EXCEPTION HANDLING
try, catch, finally, throw, throws, assert
try and catch are used to try to execute a block of code and prepare a response for (catch) the exception. Finally is added onto a try catch block to execute something no matter what.
throw lets you create custom error types i.e. 
if (age > 18) {
  throw new ArthitmeticException("The number for the age attribute is not high enough!") // which would print that message to the console if age is larger than 18
}
throws can indicate what types of exceptions/errors a method can throw. throws can capture multiple exceptions while throw will only throw the exception once
assert is used in unit testing to determine if the condition for the test is satisfied. 

CLASS RELATED
class, package, import, extends, implements, interface
A class represents a template for an object
A package contains related classes
Import is used to load and use a package or API
Extends is used to inherit a parent class, it can only be done once because Java doesn't support multiple inheritance
Implements is used to "inherit" or extend an interface. A class can implement multiple interfaces.
An interface is an abstract class with strictly abstract methods that must be filled out by the classes that implement the interface.

OBJECT RELATED KEYWORDS
new, instanceof, super, this
new creates a new object on the heap
super references the parent class 
this refers to the current object
instanceof is used to detect if an object is an instance of a specified type i.e. is this object an object of class "Node"
